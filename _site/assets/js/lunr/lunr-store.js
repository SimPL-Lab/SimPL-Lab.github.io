This study highlights a large-scale order batching model for an S-shape routing method producing very efficient solutions in a six parallel-aisle order picking system with 500 orders.   The proposed batching procedure develops batches from the predefined S-shape routes, which also produced the tight lower bound by the combination with the route-selection based relaxed batching model. This study, therefore, is able to evaluate other large-scale batching algorithms in the published literature by comparing with a lower bound.   ","categories": ["Paper summary"],

The proposed approaches are two mixed-integer programming models, the batching-only model (BOM) and the binning and batching model (BBM). The authors also propose the route packing-based binning then batching (RPBB) heuristic to solve a large-sized BBM problem consisting of a binning procedure based on route packing (BPM-RP) and a batching procedure using a simple integer programming formulation.   The paper contributes to formulate a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model for binning and batching operations which minimizes the total travel distance for small-sized problems and propose the route packing-based heuristic to solve a practical situation in large-sized problems with the binning and batching operations in the OAS.   This paper reveals that BBM minimizes the total travel distance of carts for the OASs that use worker-following cart systems. Furthermore, by proposing BBM and RPBB that shorten the total travel distance by optimizing the balance between binning and batching, this result indicates that RPBB obtains near-optimal solutions by the tight lower bound and can solve large-sized problem.

Fibrianto, and Soondo Hong      This paper aims to develop an order batching and sequencing model for zone work balancing (OBZ) in a sequential zone order picking system (OPS) as means of reducing the amount of delay time in a sequential zone OPS.   This study contributes to address the impact of order batching and the release square sequence of the tote on the workload imbalance in time from a sequential zone OPS by reducing the variables contributing to the higher amount of potential delay rather than the amount of delay itself.   The proposed approach in this paper is a mixed-integer programming model (MIP) aiming to balance the workload and minimize the make span for OBZ.   The results of the experiment conducted in this study unveils that the OBZ results in order picking efficiency in terms of stochastic environment, and it requires less computational power for every case. Furthermore, this study attests that considering larger batch window size led to better effective order picking efficiency improvement at the expense of more computational power and demonstrates OBZ’s robustly effective order picking performance when OPS experiences more frequent batch window transition.

To improve  fab performance with intuitive scheduling, practitioners have used weighted-sum scheduling. Since the determination  of weights in the scheduling significantly affects fab performance, they often rely on simulation-based decision  making for obtaining optimal weights. However, a large-scale and high-fidelity simulation generally is timeintensive to evaluate with an exhaustive search. In this study, we investigated three sampling methods (i.e., Optimal  latin hypercube sampling(OLHS), Genetic algorithm(GA), and Decision tree based sequential search(DSS)) for  the optimization. Our simulation experiments demonstrate that: (1) three methods outperform greedy heuristics  in performance metrics; (2) GA and DSS can be promising tools to accelerate the decision-making process.   http://doi.org/10.9709/JKSS.2023.32.3.067  ","categories": ["Paper summary"],

Vehicle dwelling policies assign idle vehicles to intra-bay and outer loops in automated material handling systems (AMHSs) to respond quickly to transportation demands. Fabs are motivated to control vehicle dwelling policies when fabs experience significant fluctuations, i.e., changes in product mix. Fab operators evaluate manually designed candidate solutions because it is time-intensive to run a large-scale simulation with numerous potential solutions. To determine a vehicle dwelling policy, we propose a simulation optimization approach based on Bayesian optimization (BO) with class-based clustering. BO adaptively traces efficient vehicle dwelling policies based on a surrogate model and an acquisition function. Class-based clustering alleviates the high dimensionality of the design space by grouping bays into a small number of classes. By striking a balance between the complexity of the design space and the quality of the solutions, our proposed policy significantly reduces the number of simulation runs required to determine efficient vehicle dwelling policies. We conclude that BO with class-based clustering is more advantageous than using a genetic algorithm (GA) and using heuristics.   http://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2023.3320189  ","categories": ["Paper summary"],

Terminal operators in a rail-based automated container terminal can employ the handshake operation to twin overhead shuttle cranes (OSs) under maritime demand uncertainty. Since a handshake location is critical to collaboration performance, terminal operators often rely on simulation experiments with a manual iterative design to determine optimal handshake locations. However, the simulation optimization is still challenging when a simulation execution is computationally expensive. This study proposes a Bayesian optimization-based approach to expedite the decision-making process. The approach infers the conditional outcomes of a simulation and actively searches optimal handshake locations. Our optimization results show that the proposed approach maximizes the collaborations between the twin OSs within fewer simulation runs. This study also provides extensive simulation analysis of the handshake locations. The experiments indicate that a handshake location has a significant influence on the required space for handshake operations and the workloads of the twin OSs.   http://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3323613  ","categories": ["Paper summary"],

Most existing approaches optimize storage location reassignments based on customer orders and operational configurations to maintain high order picking performance. This paper presents a Gaussian process surrogate model (GPSM) approach to predict the performance metrics for storage location reassignments. The GPSM estimates the expected flow time of orders from the historical data on previous storage location assignments and aids in identifying the new assignments that yield the minimum estimated average flow times. Management can also take advantage of the GPSM’s uncertainty quantification capability to assess the probability of improvement for a given storage reassignment and its implementation. The proposed model and assignment policy are validated using discrete-event simulations and industrial data. Experimental results demonstrate that the GPSM can improve expected flow time by 7.51% and reduce unnecessary reassignment operations by 43.25%.   https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2023.109700  ","categories": ["Paper summary"],

Filling orders with a total volume larger than a vehicle’s bin capacity, however, requires binning into multiple suborders, a procedure that influences batching performance by altering both the number of suborders and the routes for each suborder. This paper introduces the binning and batching problem (BBP) in an order picking system with pick support vehicles. To minimize the weighted sum of the number of bins and the total travel distance, we propose a binning and batching model (BBM) based on a mixed-integer programming (MIP) and an MIP-based heuristic for large-scale BBPs. Our heuristic obtains near-optimal solutions by the tight lower bound in the problems. A comparison of the heuristic and lower bound shows optimal gaps between 1.38 and 9.21% in a parallel-aisle system for 250–1000 orders. We demonstrate that the heuristic achieves the shortest travel distance for a large number of orders when the number of bins varies within a reasonable range.   https://doi.org/10.1080/01605682.2023.2283526  ","categories": ["Paper summary"],

This paper investigates a  multiple-equipment integrated scheduling problem. Firstly, the double-cycling strategy for container handling is proposed to coordinate the scheduling of quay cranes, automated guided vehicles, and yard cranes. Furthermore, a mixed-integer linear programming model is proposed to minimize the makespan of multiple-equipment. And simultaneously, an enhanced Benders decomposition algorithm is designed to solve the problem and several accelerating measures are developed to accelerate the convergence speed. The computational results indicate that (i) the schemes obtained from the model are superior to the current terminal schemes in terms of makespan, waiting time and setup time; (ii) the proposed enhanced Benders decomposition algorithm outperforms the GUROBI and existing method; and (iii) the double-cycling strategy is more efficient than the first come first serve strategy and single-cycling strategy, with 10.65% and 10.34% reductions, respectively, in makespan.   https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tre.2024.103565  ","categories": ["Paper summary"],
