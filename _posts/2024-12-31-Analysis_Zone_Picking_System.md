Title : A Simulation-based Performance Analysis of a Zone Picking System with Two Conveyor Lanes

Authors : Thao Huong Tran-Vo, Bosung Kim, and Soondo Hong 

Abstract : Sequential zone picking is an order picking method designed to enhance warehouse efficiency by dividing the storage area into multiple zones and picking items in a sequential order across these zones. Picked items are often placed in dedicated totes and transported between zones using a conveyor system, which manages the picking flow but can occasionally result in inefficiencies during the process. This study presents a variant of the sequential zone picking system, called a dual-lane zone picking system (DZP), which consists of two parallel conveyor lanes without buffers between consecutive zones. This conveyor configuration allows the picker in each zone to alternate processing between the two lanes, thereby lessening the constraints of tote transitions between zones and improving both system throughput and picker utilization. We design and conduct a series of experiments using a discrete-event simulation model to evaluate the performance of DZPs. The experiment results indicate that DZP surpasses the original single-lane zone picking system by shortening the system’s mean flow time in low flow intensity scenarios and achieving a higher maximum throughput and worker utilization in high flow intensity scenarios. Additionally, we investigate the effects of the number of zones and order batching size on the performance of DZP to gain further insights into the system’s operational control.
