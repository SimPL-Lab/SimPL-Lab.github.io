Title : A simulation-based optimization for scheduling in a fab: comparative study on different sampling methods

Abstract : A semiconductor fabrication facility(FAB) is one of the most capital-intensive and large-scale manufacturing  systems which operate under complex and uncertain constraints through hundreds of fabrication steps. To improve  fab performance with intuitive scheduling, practitioners have used weighted-sum scheduling. Since the determination  of weights in the scheduling significantly affects fab performance, they often rely on simulation-based decision  making for obtaining optimal weights. However, a large-scale and high-fidelity simulation generally is timeintensive to evaluate with an exhaustive search. In this study, we investigated three sampling methods (i.e., Optimal  latin hypercube sampling(OLHS), Genetic algorithm(GA), and Decision tree based sequential search(DSS)) for  the optimization. Our simulation experiments demonstrate that: (1) three methods outperform greedy heuristics  in performance metrics; (2) GA and DSS can be promising tools to accelerate the decision-making process.
