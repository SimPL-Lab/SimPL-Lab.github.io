# A dynamic storage location assignment model for a progressive bypass zone picking system with an S/R crane

- This paper optimizes the storage locations with consideration of workload imbalance and reduction of recirculation in a progressive bypass zone picking system.
- This paper also suggests a dynamic storage location assignment when the system has a limited material handling capacity.
- This paper develops an SLA model that considers both workload balance and recirculation reduction, and an SLR model that switches pairs of products in warehouses with limited material handling capacity.
- SLA is preferable for long-term planning over monthly and seasonal changes, and SLR is preferable for daily changes because it modulate daily demand fluctuation with relatively little effort.
