Taehoon Lee has been awarded a new research project from the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF), funded by the Korea government, as the Principal Investigator. The project, titled "Simulation-based Just-in-Time Operations for Lean Fulfillment", will be conducted from September 2025 to August 2027. This funding will enable us to advance our research on simulation-based just-in-time operations to enhance the efficiency of lean fulfillment systems.
