# Sequential Optimization of a Temporary Storage Location for Cooperative Twin Overhead Shuttles in a Rail-based Automated Container Terminal

### Author: Bonggwon Kang, Bosung Kim, and Soondo Hong
[https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-16407-1_34](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-16407-1_34)
- For prompt and effective simulation-based decision-making in yard operations, we propose a data-driven optimization approach for determining the handoff location to minimize the maximum workload of twin OSs.
