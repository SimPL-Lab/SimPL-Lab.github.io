Title : Analysis of the Impact of Resource Allocation Strategy on the Scheduling of Core Defense Technology Project Agreements

Abstract : There is a demand for introducing a challenging and innovative R&D system to develop new technologies to generate weapon system requirements. Despite the increasing trend in annual core technology development tasks, the infrastructure expansion, includ- ing personnel in research management institutions, is relatively insufficient. This situation continuously exposes difficulties in task planning, selection, execution, and management. Therefore, there is a pressing need for strategies to initiate timely research and development and enhance budget execution efficiency through the streamlining of task agreement schedules. In this study, we propose a strategic model utilizing a flexible workforce model, considering constraints and optimizing workload distribution through resource allocation to minimize bottlenecks for efficient task agreement schedules. Comparative analysis with the existing operational environment confirms that the proposed model can handle an average of 67 more core technology development tasks within the agreement period compared to the baseline. In addition, the risk management analysis, which considered the probabilistic uncertainty of the fluctuating number of core technology research and development projects, confirmed that up to115 core technology development can be contracted within the year under risk avoidance.
