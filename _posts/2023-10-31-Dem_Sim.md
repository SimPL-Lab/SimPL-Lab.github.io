This video is a demonstration of our simulation models. We have built this automated material handling system simulation in variou industries, analyzed material handling performance, and proposed optimization solutions. Regarding the automated material handling system simulation, we proposed an optimization approach for prompt reaction of the vehicles to upcoming transportation demand and validated the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can accelerate the simulation-based vehicle management process with improved material handling performance. The research has been published in IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10278155](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10278155).
