Title : The benefits of a dual-lane zone picking system with buffer-free conveyor lanes: An analytical approach

Authors : Thao Huong Tran-Vo, Young Myoung Ko, Soondo Hong

Abstract : The increasing prevalence of small-footprint warehouses in urban areas necessitates a system that accommodates both fast order processing and space-saving requirements. This study introduces a Dual-lane Zone Picking system (DZP) featuring dual buffer-free conveyor lanes to improve picking performance in such warehouses. We develop an analytical model for a two-zone DZP, incorporating zone passing, a notable feature in sequential zone picking systems. We fit phase-type distributions for tote interarrival times and tote picking times, model the system as a Continuous-Time Markov Chain with a block-form transition generator, and apply the matrix geometric method to obtain the systemâ€™s stationary distribution and performance metrics. Numerical experiments demonstrate that DZP considerably reduces mean flow time and yields higher maximum throughput compared to traditional single-lane zone picking systems, especially in two-zone systems with high zone-passing probabilities. The results highlight the potential of the DZP to improve order picking efficiency and provide valuable insights into operational control.
