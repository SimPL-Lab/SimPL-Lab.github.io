- This paper proposes an order batching formulation and heuristic solution procedure appropriate for a large-scale order picking situation in a parallel-aisle picking system. 
- By comparing with a lower bound developed as a linear programming relaxation of the batching formulation, this study demonstrates the quality of the solutions, in which the procedure developed in this paper contributes to efficient and effective DC design and operation. 
- A simulation study indicates that the proposed heuristic algorithm outperforms the existing methods described in the literature or used in practice.
