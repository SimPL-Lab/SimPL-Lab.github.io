The 2nd Joint Workshop on Recent Digital Twin and Production Logistics Research (DTPL) was held from August 11 to 16, 2024, at the University of Washington. Attendees included Bonggwon Kang, Gwangheon Lee, Prof. Soondo Hong, and Prof. Chiwoo Park. During the workshop, we engaged in in-depth discussions on collaborative research related to digital twin-based decision-making in the warehouse and semiconductor industries. We would like to extend our special gratitude to Prof. Park for his significant efforts and time in organizing and inviting us to this event.
