## Undergraduate level
### Simulation
Course objectives: This course introduces discrete-event simulation modeling and analysis. It consists of the theoretical and
statistical aspects of simulation, the simulation language, the analysis of the simulation outputs, and
practical extensions  

This course starts with fundamentals of the discrete-event simulation such as an overview of computer simulation,
probability models for simulation, and event-based modeling and simulation. Then, this course fathoms a
software-based simulation. Based on the simulation software, this course learns simulation modeling, process
modeling, output analyzing, and modeling of specific functions.
### Facilities Planning & Material handling systems
Course objectives: Various practical approaches and theoretical approaches are discussed for solving problems of facilities
planning.  

The course includes algorithms for computerized layout planning and the design and operation of material handling
systems. It will also be discussed how to design and operate manufacturing facilities, material handling systems,
and storage systems. Some knowledge of operations research and statistics is used. A term project will be
assigned to make students experience the problem definition, the formulation of the problem, and the solution
procedure.
### Engineering economy
Course objectives: To Understand basics of engineering economy and cost concepts; To evaluate the feasibility of investment; To understand decision making with cost analysis  

This course covers discounted cash flow methods for analyzing and evaluating proposed
projects and investments. These basic skills are useful in all areas of engineering, as
well as in many other areas of life (including personal financial decisions). The
course covers topics in Engineering Economy and Cost Analysis: Principles of economic
equivalence; time value of money; analysis of single and multiple investments;
comparison of alternatives; capital recovery and tax implications; certainty;
uncertainty; risk analysis; and public sector analysis and break-even concepts.
### Operations Management
Course objectives: This course enables students to establish the advanced concepts of production management by studying advanced
concepts, frameworks, and tools of production management, and to obtain introductory knowledge on quality
management, process analysis and design, forecasting, independent and dependent inventory systems, and project
management. Moreover, students can learn advanced technology through case studies of world-class companies.

### Material handling systems
Course objectives: This course provides an introduction to the field of material handling systems, including systems analysis,
operational performance analysis, and the operation optimization for material handling systems in the industrial
plant or warehouse.  

Students will learn how to design and evaluate material handling operations in automated storage/retrieval
systems (AS/RSs), automated guided vehicles (AGVs), conveyor systems, and order picking systems. The course also
includes algorithms for the operation of material handling systems. Some knowledges on applied probability, queueing
theory, and operations research is used. A term project will be assigned to make students experience the
problem definition, the formulation of the problem, the solution procedure, and the validation and related
experiments.

### Production Systems Analysis
Course objectives: This course deals with production systems analysis based on probability models and simulation approaches.
The course aims to learn how to analyze the production systems in terms of productivity and variability with
industry cases and projects.  

The course covers the history of manufacturing, production lines, manufacturing planning systems, supply chains,
and lean manufacturing as well. Students will learn to identify the components of the process and flow variability,
how to measure these, and how to use models to predict their influence on manufacturing system performance.
Students will learn the key parameters and performance measures of manufacturing systems such as queueing
systems, logistic systems, and inventory systems.
