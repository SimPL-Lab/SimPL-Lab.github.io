    <h3>Mission statement</h3>
    <p style = "font-size:110%;">The objective of the Simulation & Production Logistics (SimPL) Laboratory is to develop large-scale simulation models, 
        operational algorithms, machine learning models that will improve the operations and productivity of logistics and related production systems. 
        Active research areas include simulation optimization, material handling and self-organizing operations, 
        and OR applications in warehousing, semiconductor, display, and automobile industries.</p>
